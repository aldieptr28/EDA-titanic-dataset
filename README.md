### Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis  

This project uses the Titanic dataset as a case study for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The goal is to identify patterns and key factors that influenced passenger survival. The dataset we used is available at the following link:

The dataset contains 499 cleaned entries with 4 columns: survived, name, sex, and age. Initially, the data had 500 entries, but we found duplicate values and missing values, especially in the age column. After cleaning, the dataset became more reliable for analysis.

We began by importing the data and checking its structure and data types. Duplicate entries were removed to maintain data quality. Missing values in numerical columns were filled using the median, while categorical columns were filled using the mode. These steps ensured the dataset was ready for further exploration.

### Insight  
Insights I gained from this project include:

- Female passengers had a much higher survival rate than male passengers.  
- Passengers in first class had better survival chances than those in second or third class.  
- Younger passengers, especially children, showed slightly higher survival rates.  
- The 'age' column initially had many missing values, which were handled using median imputation.  
- Duplicate entries were identified and removed to ensure clean analysis.
